    <h3> What is Binge Eating Disorder ?</h3>
    <p> Binge Eating Disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder and is characterized by regular episodes of eating unusually large amounts of food in a short time, often feeling unable to stop. Unlike bulimia, individuals with BED do not engage in compensatory behaviors like purging after a binge.</p>

  <div class="details-details">
    <h3> Symptoms of Binge Eating Disorder </h3>
    <p> Frequent episodes of eating large amounts of food, even when not hungry. <br>
      Eating rapidly and often to the point of discomfort. <br>
      Feelings of guilt, shame, or distress about binge eating, but not engaging in purging or fasting afterward. <br>
      Emotional eating, often using food as a way to cope with negative emotions like stress, anxiety, or sadness.</p>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <div class="details-details">
    <h3> Causes of Binge Eating Disorder </h3>
    <p> Biological Factors: Hormonal imbalances and genetics may play a role in the development of BED.  <br>
      Emotional Eating: People often binge in response to stress, sadness, boredom, or other negative emotions. <br>
      Dieting: Restrictive dieting can lead to a cycle of deprivation followed by binging. <br>
      Psychological Factors: Low self-esteem, loneliness, and past trauma are common among individuals with BED.</p>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <div class="details-details">
    <h3> Health Consequences of Binge Eating Disorder </h3>
    <p> Obesity-Related Issues: Increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, and joint pain. <br>
      Mental Health Issues: Guilt, shame, depression, and anxiety often accompany binge eating episodes. <br>
      Sleep Problems: Individuals may suffer from sleep apnea or insomnia due to weight gain and emotional distress. <br>
      Gastrointestinal Issues: Digestive problems, bloating, and acid reflux are common among individuals who overeat.</p>
    <hr>
  </div>
  <div class="details-details">
    <h3> Treatment and Recovery</h3>
    <p> Therapy: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) are effective in helping individuals break the cycle of binge eating. <br>
      Nutritional Counseling: Help with developing a healthy relationship with food and establishing regular eating patterns. <br>
      Medication: Certain antidepressants and medications like Vyvanse (approved for BED) may be used to reduce binge episodes.<br>
      Support Networks: Regular attendance at support groups or sessions with a dietitian can help maintain progress in recovery.<br>
      Self-Compassion: Part of recovery involves learning to be kind to oneself and breaking the cycle of self-blame.</p>

  <div class="details-details">
    <h3> How to Support Someone with Binge Eating Disorder </h3>
    <p> Be Nonjudgmental: Donâ€™t criticize or belittle their eating habits or weight.<br>
      Offer Emotional Support: Help them manage stress and emotions that may trigger binge eating.<br>
      Promote Professional Help: Encourage them to seek therapy or counseling for BED.<br>
      Avoid Diet Talk: Focus on overall health and well-being rather than weight or dieting.</p>
