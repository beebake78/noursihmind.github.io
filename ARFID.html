    <div class="details-details">
    <h3> What is Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder?</h3>
    <p> Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is a relatively new diagnosis that involves eating disturbances that are not related to concerns about body image or weight, but instead a lack of interest in food or a fear of certain foods due to sensory sensitivities or fear of choking or vomiting.

    </p>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <div class="details-details">
    <h3> Symptoms of ARFID</h3>
    <p> Avoidance of certain foods or food groups based on texture, smell, or appearance. <br>
      Lack of interest in eating or food, leading to difficulty meeting nutritional needs. <br>
      Fear of eating due to a past traumatic experience such as choking, gagging, or vomiting. <br>
      Failure to thrive or poor growth in children due to insufficient food intake.</p>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <div class="details-details">
    <h3> Causes of ARFID</h3>
    <p> Sensory Sensitivities: Individuals may be sensitive to certain textures, smells, or appearances of food.<br>
      Fear of Adverse Consequences: Fear of choking, vomiting, or allergic reactions can lead to avoidance of certain foods.<br>
      Trauma: A traumatic experience related to food or eating (e.g., choking incident) can trigger the onset of ARFID.<br>
      Developmental Factors: Some individuals with ARFID may also have conditions like autism, where sensory sensitivities are more pronounced.</p>
    <hr>
  </div>

  <div class="details-details">
    <h3> Health Consequences of ARFID</h3>
    <p> Nutritional Deficiencies: Lack of variety in food intake can lead to vitamin and mineral deficiencies, including anemia, bone density loss, and weakened immunity.<br>
      Stunted Growth: In children and adolescents, inadequate food intake can lead to poor growth and development.<br>
      Weight Loss: Unintentional weight loss or failure to gain weight, which can affect energy levels and overall health.<br>
      Social Isolation: ARFID can lead to anxiety about eating in public or with others, resulting in social withdrawal.
    </p>
    <hr>
  </div>
  <div class="details-details">
    <h3> Treatment and Recovery</h3>
    <p> Exposure Therapy: Gradual exposure to feared or avoided foods in a safe, supportive environment can help desensitize individuals with ARFID.<br>
      Nutritional Intervention: Working with a dietitian to ensure they are meeting their nutritional needs, often through supplements or meal plans.<br>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT): This helps individuals challenge and change their food-related fears and behaviors.<br>
      Family-Based Treatment (FBT): In younger individuals, families can play a crucial role in encouraging healthy eating behaviors.<br>
      Occupational Therapy: For those with sensory sensitivities, therapy can help them better tolerate a wider range of foods.
    </p>

  <div class="details-details">
    <h3> How to Support Someone with ARFID</h3>
    <p>Be Patient: ARFID involves deeply ingrained fears or sensory issues, so change will likely be gradual.<br>
      Avoid Pressure: Donâ€™t force them to eat certain foods. Instead, encourage small steps toward expanding their diet.<br>
      Celebrate Progress: Praise any small victory in trying new foods or eating outside their comfort zone.<br>
      Provide Safe Foods: Offer a variety of safe, familiar foods and slowly introduce new options as they become comfortable.</p>
